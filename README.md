# Automated UI Testing Framework using Selenium, Python, and Pytest

This repository contains a UI automation testing framework built using Selenium WebDriver, Python, Pytest, pytest-html, and openpyxl. The framework is designed to test the functionality of the [Katalon Demo Cura Healthcare Service](https://katalon-demo-cura.herokuapp.com/) website by performing automated tests and generating HTML reports.

## Framework Components

### 1. Selenium WebDriver

[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/) is a powerful tool for automating web browsers. It enables interaction with web elements, navigation, and form submission.

### 2. Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a widely-used programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It serves as the primary language for writing test scripts and managing automation tasks.

### 3. Pytest

[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) is a testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases. It provides various features for organizing tests, fixtures, and assertions.

### 4. pytest-html

[pytest-html](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-html/) is a plugin for Pytest that generates HTML reports for test results. It offers detailed information about test cases, including pass/fail status, execution time, and logs.

### 5. openpyxl

[openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a Python library for reading and writing Excel files. It allows the framework to extract test data from Excel sheets and use it for test execution.

## Getting Started

To set up the testing framework locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Update the configuration file (config.py) with appropriate settings such as browser type, test data file path, etc.
4.Run the tests using Pytest:
```bash
pytest --html=reports/report.html
5. After test execution, open the generated HTML report located in the reports folder to view test results.

### Test Case Execution Flow
The framework reads test data from an Excel file using openpyxl.
It navigates to the Katalon Demo Cura website using Selenium WebDriver.
Test cases are executed to perform various actions such as making appointments, verifying text, etc.
Assertions are used to validate expected outcomes.
Test results are logged and displayed in the HTML report generated by pytest-html.

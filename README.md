# Automated UI Testing Framework using Selenium, Python, and Pytest

This repository contains a UI automation testing framework built using Selenium WebDriver, Python, Pytest, pytest-html, and openpyxl. The framework is designed to test the functionality of the [Katalon Demo Cura Healthcare Service](https://katalon-demo-cura.herokuapp.com/) website by performing automated tests and generating HTML reports.

## Framework Components

### 1. Selenium WebDriver

[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/) is a powerful tool for automating web browsers. It enables interaction with web elements, navigation, and form submission.

### 2. Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a widely-used programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It serves as the primary language for writing test scripts and managing automation tasks.

### 3. Pytest

[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) is a testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases. It provides various features for organizing tests, fixtures, and assertions.

### 4. pytest-html

[pytest-html](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-html/) is a plugin for Pytest that generates HTML reports for test results. It offers detailed information about test cases, including pass/fail status, execution time, and logs.

### 5. openpyxl

[openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a Python library for reading and writing Excel files. It allows the framework to extract test data from Excel sheets and use it for test execution.
